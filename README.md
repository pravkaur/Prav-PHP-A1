# Read me File
## Peer reviewed by Milan, my suggestions and changes:
1. Try to avoid using spaces while naming the files, so I added dashes to the original name to fix that.
2. I added your name to the code file (that's good practice), but you also could add a date, so that you know when this wa created
3. Fixed an error in your line 60, where you were refering to the value of the associative array, instead of its key.
4. Added this readme file (forgot to mention).
